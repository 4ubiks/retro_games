# Snake

Snake is a retro-style game released in 1997 for a Nokia cell phone. The idea is quite simple, the user is maneuvering a snake whose end continues to grow as the user consumes apples. The goal is to avoid colliding with the wall or yourself, which gets more difficult as the game continues. When the snake has reached the size of the entire garden, the user wins.
